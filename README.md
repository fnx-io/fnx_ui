"Desktop first" pure Dart angular2 components for creating Material design friendly web applications.

# Desktop first? What kind of heresy is that?
 
Yeah, we all love our smartphones. But there are still many applications, which are operated almost exclusively on desktop.
Backend administrations, information systems, "form heavy" apps ... Purpose of this library is to create a collection
of angular2 components optimized for this particular type of applications.

# It doesn't work on mobile?

Yes it does, and we are trying to keep it this way. But - the emphasis is on desktop. 

# CSS

        cd stylesheet
        gulp devel
        
Then open http://localhost:8085/

        gulp release

Then see stylesheet/_dist/.
         
# Angular2 components
         
         cd ng2
         pub serve example
         
Then see http://localhost:8080/

# P.S.

Work in progress.
